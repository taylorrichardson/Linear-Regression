In this analysis I try to determine if I could predict body fat with a linear regression model.

The results had a 71% R2 score, so it wasn't bad. Based on our RMSE of 2.6, being greater than 10% of our dependant variable's mean of 2.02, which means our model has high error variance. 

This means that our model is relatively accurate and could be used for predictive analysis but isnâ€™t accurate enough to make dependable forecasts.
